# fake-news-detection-ml
A machine learning project to classify news as fake or real using TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost.

# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project identifies whether a news article is **Fake** or **Real** using text classification techniques. It applies natural language processing (NLP) with machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**, combined with **TF-IDF** vectorization.

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: [Fake and Real News Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
- Files used:
  - `Fake.csv` — Fake news articles
  - `True.csv` — Real news articles

---

## 💡 Objective

To build a binary text classifier that can:
- Detect fake news articles based on their content
- Compare performance across multiple ML models
- Provide evaluation metrics and confusion matrix visualizations

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Google Colab

---

## 🧠 ML Models Implemented

- ✅ Logistic Regression
- ✅ Random Forest Classifier
- ✅ XGBoost Classifier

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy Score
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix (visualized)
- Classification Reports

---

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the dataset files (`Fake.csv`, `True.csv`).
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the models.
